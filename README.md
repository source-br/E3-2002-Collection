## About the project:

This project aims to recreate the maps, sounds, and models showcased at E3 2002, bringing that unique experience to the retail version of Half-Life 2.
Although we are still in the development phase, we have already released the E3_Ship and E3_Town maps, now fully playable, featuring weapon models and textures extracted directly from the game's beta version.
We are committed to continuing updates to the project and plan to include even more maps in the future, staying faithful to the original material presented in that iconic E3 demonstration.
